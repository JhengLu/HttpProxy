<h2>Project Description</h2>

<p>This project is developed in C language and utilizes the <code>fork</code> and <code>waitpid</code> functions to create an HTTP proxy with multiple processes.</p>

<p>You can use this project to set up a high-performance HTTP proxy that can handle multiple connections simultaneously. By using the <code>fork</code> and <code>waitpid</code> functions, the project is able to create child processes that can handle incoming requests independently, allowing for faster and more efficient processing.</p>

<p>If you're looking for a powerful HTTP proxy implementation that is optimized for performance, this project is a great place to start.</p>
